# Advent of Code in Kotlin - All events from 2015

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual programming competition with a Christmas-y theme. It runs during Advent, from December 1st to the 25th.

I'm backtracking to the first AoC set of problems, having already started solving some of the more recent years' puzzles. My goal is to get all fifty stars for each year and solve the puzzles using Kotlin. This repository is a record of this multi-year exercise.

## Sources of inspiration

I've learned quite a few lessons since I started learning Kotlin by solving AoC puzzles. I couldn't have done it without help and inspiration from others though so I want to take a moment to acknowledge the folks who are much smarter and better than me in Kotlin and in programming in general. 

* [Todd Ginsberg](https://github.com/tginsberg) - I saw some posts from Todd on Reddit and the Kotlin programs he writes are generally very clear and elegant.
* Andrew Pickett - I know Andrew from work. He's a beast. He does his AoC in Python as far as I can tell but his solutions are still good examples to learn from.
* Stephan van Hulst - A fellow moderator at [CodeRanch](https://coderanch.com), Stephan is a great programmer and always has great takes on problems and how they might be solved in Kotlin or whatever language he's using at the moment.

## Acknowledgements

I want to acknowledge and thank [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl), creator and maintainer of Advent of Code. I encourage you to donate and support Eric so he can continue the awesome work of bringing joy to countless developers every December. May his project continue to grow and prosper.
