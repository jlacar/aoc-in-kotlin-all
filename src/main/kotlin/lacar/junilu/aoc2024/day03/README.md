> "When faced with a problem, some people say 'Let's use RegEx.' Now, they have two problems." --some wise person on the Internet

See https://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247 and decide who to attribute that quote to.

## Approach

Let me just start by saying this: I don't like problems that involve RegEx. That being said, I solved this using regular expressions. Took me over three hours of wrangling with the matches to find the right incantation. Somewhere in the middle of my frustration, I considered giving up and taking a more brute force approach. Sunk Cost prevented me from doing that though so I muddled through.
