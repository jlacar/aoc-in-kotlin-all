# AoC 2025: Day 1 - Secret Entrance

Puzzle Page: https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1 

Code: [solution](Day01.kt) | [test](../../../../../../test/kotlin/lacar/junilu/aoc2025/day01/Day01Test.kt)

## Overview

This problem involves modulo arithmetic. I really should make a habit of reacquainting myself with my past solutions and the useful utilities I have collected over the years. If I had done that, I could have saved a bit of time by not reinventing the wheel for calculating a wrapping index.

Most AoC problems start out with a simple scenario whose solution can be generalized to solve the rest of the problem. This is the case for this problem although it took me a while to find a way to generalize the initial solution.
