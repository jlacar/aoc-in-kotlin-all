# Advent of Code 2015 - In Kotlin

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual programming competition with a Christmas-y theme. It runs during Advent, from December 1st to the 25th.

I'm backtracking to the first AoC set of problems, having already started solving some of the more recent years' puzzles. My goal is to get all fifty stars for each year and solve the puzzles using Kotlin.

I've learned a few lessons since then and I'm applying those learnings here. Also taking some inspiration from [Todd Ginsberg](https://github.com/tginsberg) and the way he approaches solving these problems in Kotlin.

## General approach

I'll be doing Test-Driven Development to solve all of these puzzles, so there should be tests for every solution class. Following my practice in real-world development, I use the tests as a drawing board, a way to experiment with different options, and as a sandbox for experiments.

I'm using the `Solution` interface to define the shape of a solution. The interface defines the `part1()` and `part2()` functions, with the return type specified as a generic parameter. Most of the solutions will be defined as `Solution<Int>` because most of the puzzle answers are numeric.

A common pattern I'm using is that of the companion object as a builder or factory. I'll usually name the factory method as `using` because it reads very naturally when passed in the input. 

You'll see an example of this in the Day 1 test:

    private val day01 = Day01.using(readResource("day01"))

The tests are also organized so that I can run the puzzle solutions separately from the examples. A test class will typically have nested `Examples` and `Solution` classes to house their respective set of tests.

## Utilities 

There are some basic operations that come in handy in solving these problems. One such operation is calculating permutations. I looked around for some implementations and I found [one that was workable](https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/chapter6.html), although it was written in Python. No biggie, converting Python code to Kotlin is fairly straightforward. 

This is the Python code, without the informational print statements:

    def getPerms(chars, indent=0):
        if len(chars) == 1:
        return [chars]
    
        # RECURSIVE CASE
        permutations = []
        head = chars[0]
        tail = chars[1:]
        tailPermutations = getPerms(tail, indent + 1)
        for tailPerm in tailPermutations:
            for i in range(len(tailPerm) + 1):
                newPerm = tailPerm[0:i] + head + tailPerm[i:]
                permutations.append(newPerm)
        return permutations

This was easily translated to Kotlin but there were a few changes I made in the process. I kept with the general approach but added one guard clause for an empty list, which I'd expect to return an empty list. The Python implementation is done in an imperative style. I translated this to a more functional style.

The first thing I did was to add a couple of extension properties, `head` and `tail` to `List<T>`. I got these off of a StackOverflow thread I happened upon while looking for permutations solutions in Kotlin, of which there were surprisingly few.

    val <T> List<T>.head: T
        get() = first()
    
    val <T> List<T>.tail: List<T>
        get() = drop(1)

I also made `permutations()` an function of `List<T>`:

    fun <T> List<T>.permutations(): List<List<T>> { ... }

Then I added a check for the "zero" case where the list was empty. I'd expect `permutations()` to return an empty list here. I kept the "one" base case, of course, where a list with only one element returns the list itself as its only permutation.

For the recursive part of the logic, the `head` and `tail` extension properties really helped simplify and clarify the Kotlin logic. 

Using `fold()` operations instead of for-loops allowed me streamline the Kotlin code. Specifically, I eliminated or inlined the temporary variables. The `permutations` variable from the Python code was now the outer `fold()` operation's accumulator variable, initialized in call to `fold()` itself. The `tailPermutations` variable became an inline call `tail.permutations()` which because the receive of the outer `fold()` operation.

The inner for-loop from Python also became a `fold()` operation. With the `+` operator overloaded for `List<T>`, adding the elements of each permutation together was easy. The only thing that looks a little weird is the 

    fun <T> List<T>.permutations(): List<List<T>> {
        if (isEmpty()) return emptyList()
        if (size == 1) return listOf(this)

        return tail.permutations()
            .fold(mutableListOf()) { allPerms, perm ->
                (0..perm.size).fold(allPerms) { acc, i ->
                    acc.add(perm.subList(0, i) + head + perm.subList(i, perm.size))
                    acc
                }
            }
    }
