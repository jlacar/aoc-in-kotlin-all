# Day 17 - No Such Thing as Too Much

[This problem](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/17) is another [combinatorial problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) and the solution revolves around calculating [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) of a given set of items. In this case, the items are containers which must be filled with a specified amount of eggnog.

## Part 1

This part requires you to find the number of different ways 150 liters of eggnog can be exactly distributed over containers from a given collection of containers of different sizes. Each container used must be filled fully.

## Part 2

This part requires you to find the minimum number of containers needed to hold exactly 150 liters of eggnog. Then you need to find how many different ways that much eggnog can be distributed over that many containers.
